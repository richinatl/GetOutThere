  ## Description
  A react mockup of an applicatioin to create, store, and share events around town and around the world. I believe this has a lot of potential. I only spent a couple of days working on this, using some components I'd created before and adding some new ones. I really feel like with a login system, a few more added features, and integrating a payment and or advertising feature this could be something huge. For now it was an opportunity to use my React skills and make another progression into being a better developer
